Batch achieves this by utilizing queue processing of batch job requests. To successfully submit a job for execution, you need the following resources:

* Job Definition - Group various job properties (container image, resource requirements, env variablesâ€¦) into a single definition. These definitions are used at job submission time.
* Compute Environment - the execution runtime of submitted batch jobs
* Job Queue - the queue where batch jobs can be submitted to via AWS SDK/CLI
